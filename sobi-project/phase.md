##  Peer Review

###  Pull Request Reviewed:
[Peer PR Reviewed](https://github.com/Abukduot/HerTech/pull/15)

###  Review Summary:
I reviewed my peerâ€™s Terraform configuration and Docker deployment setup. My comments included:
- Suggesting to use `terraform.tfvars` to separate sensitive data from main config.
- Pointing out a missing dependency link between App Service and ACR.
- Recommending use of output variables for resource URIs and credentials.
  
I also acknowledged well-structured resource naming and modularized Terraform scripts.

##  Reflection

Phase 2 of this project provided deep insight into the challenges and power of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and cloud deployment.

###  Key Challenges Faced:
- Troubleshooting Terraform errors during ACR and App Service provisioning.
- Authenticating the App Service to pull from ACR securely using a managed identity.
- Dealing with the complexity of networking between Azure services (e.g., VNet and MySQL connection issues).
- Structuring the Dockerfile and Compose file to work across local and cloud environments.

###  Lessons Learned:
- IaC helps standardize infrastructure but requires strong debugging skills.
- Clear environment variable and secret management is essential for secure and stable deployments.
- Azure's resource configuration is detailed and requires careful reading of the documentation.

Despite the complexity, this experience has strengthened my confidence in managing cloud deployments using Terraform, Docker, and Azure services.
